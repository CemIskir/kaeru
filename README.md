Kaeru
=====

Files for the [Kaeru Language](http://www.kaeru-lang.org) website.
Eventually, these should be on a dedicated branch of this repository, but for now I guess this is fine.

How to Update the Site
----------------------

Don't for now. Instructions to come after the Django site is up and running.

<!-- The user-facing website is at http://www.kaeru-lang.org, which is hosted on [Cornell Systems Lab](http://www.systems.cs.cornell.edu) servers. -->
<!-- Use the following workflow to push updates to the main site: -->

<!-- 1. Clone this repository locally. Move to the `web/` folder. -->
<!-- 2. Hack, hack, hack. View the site _locally_ until you're ready to make the changes live. -->
<!-- 3. Run `make` to update the server files. Enter your password to `kaeru-lang.org` when prompted. -->
<!-- 4. Admire your changes at http://www.kaeru-lang.org -->

<!-- Don't forget to push your updates to the main repo (`git push origin master`). -->
<!-- Enjoy! -->
